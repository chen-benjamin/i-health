            " One of the least stressful and accessible forms of exercise is walking. For some seniors, walking is a bigger challenge than others, so distance and step goals differ from person to person. For the general population, 10,000 steps per day is advised for a healthy lifestyle, but those with difficulty walking or joint pain may settle for a smaller number as a goal. A PLOS One study found that walking 10,000 steps lowered the ten-year outlook for mortality by 46%. Walking promotes a healthy lifestyle, while strengthening muscles, lowering your risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and colon cancer. ",

Itâ€™s recommended that you attend a class first to understand and perform the movements accurately and then you can do them on your own anywhere you choose. Some yoga and tai chi classes are even held outside, giving you the opportunity to exercise outdoors while improving your balance.",
